# Amazon Interview Plan

## General Questions to expect

### From the recruiter

* Data, data, data. Amazon is a data-driven company, so please be prepared to explain how you personally have utilized data, found new resources to harvest data and anything in between in order to drive to your results.
    * Something to keep in mind. The use of “I” versus “we” as you speak to your interviewer – it’s good to acknowledge the work of your team, but this is your time to brag and shine about your individual contributions, so do not hold back on your accomplishments.
* I cannot emphasize enough, that your interviewer will ask you open-ended questions to see what follow up questions you ask in return. When you’re asked a broad question, ensure you ask clarifying questions to understand requirements and then begin to solve last after you’ve communicated clearly your path to solve. Also, consider/ask about edge cases before they’re brought to your attention.

# Amazon Leadership Principles Examples

## 1. Customer Obsession

    Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

I've been asked this before.  It gets weird for some, but as a UI person, this is front and center.

|       |       |
| ----- | ----- |
| Situation | Annual Survey at International Paper (myView) |
| Task | As a developer for internal applications, I was asked if I felt the company was focused on the customer |
| Action | This tripped me up because I write internal stuff, but the reality is the users of my app have constant direct interaction with the customers.  Because no one in any IT team had any direct user feedback, we had no idea what we could do to give our reps the best opportunity to make our customers happy |
| Result | Other teammates had similar concerns.  However, it was decided on review that another pain-point was to be focused on.  I continued my efforts by advocating for the ability for users to provide direct feedback within the app shell. |

## 2. Ownership

    Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job”.

## 3. Invent and Simplify

    Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find way to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here”. As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

## 7. Insist on the Highest Standards

Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
