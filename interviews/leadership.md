# 1. Customer Obsession

    Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

I've been asked this before.  It gets weird for some, but as a UI person, this is front and center.

| Situation | MyView | Annual Survey at International Paper (myView) |
| Task | Was Asked Customer Focus | As a developer for internal applications, I was asked if I felt the company was focused on the customer |
| Action | x | This tripped me up because I write internal stuff, but the reality is the users of my app have constant direct interaction with the customers.  Because no one in any IT team had any direct user feedback, we had no idea what we could do to give our reps the best opportunity to make our customers happy |
| Result | x | Other teammates had similar concerns.  However, it was decided on review that another pain-point was to be focused on.  I continued my efforts by advocating for the ability for users to provide direct feedback within the app shell. |

# 2. Ownership

    Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job”.

# 3. Invent and Simplify

    Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find way to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here”. As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

# 4. Are Right, a Lot

    Leaders are right a lot. They have strong business judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

# 7. Insist on the Highest Standards

    Leaders have relentlessly high standards – many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

## Thoughts on the topic

This is crucial in frontend development.  Falling short of standards directly impacts users. This is especially if the app is external.  However, even internal applications

# 8. Think Big

    Think Big Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

# 11. Earn Trust

    Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
