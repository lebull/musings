# My Turn

## My Salary Expectations

* I'm expecting 100k-120k, but I will certainly still consider offers outside of that range

## Hiring Manage

* Here is my situation....  Is there any chance I can get an office spot?
* Workload... Periodic or sporiladic?
* Do you switch up your toolbelt?
* Why is this team remote?

### Presgestion

* How large is the team?
* Where is the team
* What do tou di to develope a team culture with remote employees
* What is the spread of experience

# Teammates

* Workload... Periodic or sporiladic?
* What times are "working hours?
* Do you switch up your toolbelt


## Bar Raiser

* Try to converse about LPs
  * Customer focus. Obviously the user buying products/services is a customer.  But does Amazon consider internal users to be customers?
