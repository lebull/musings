## 1. Tell me about a time when you were not able to meet a time commitment. What prevented you from meeting it? What was the outcome and what did you learn from it?

### Pestweb: Legal Changes

|       |       |       |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Situation | Company Transfer | x |
| Task | Rewrite legal pages | x |
| Action | Was more complicated expected. | x |
| Result | Still delivered legally, but not on the intended date. | Learned that even for simple changes, you can expect surprises and oversites.  Also, communication could have helped here. |

CPB Sale?

## 2. Describe a long-term project that you managed. How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner?

Distance Internal Applications

Moving over distance content to the cms

* Distance State
* Tasked with moving content from 25 degree programs to CMS
* I Split the task up
  * Divide the task up and delivered one set of related programs at a time
  * When starting out, I always started with small, trivial, or fun parts.  This gave me confidence when  got to the monotonous parts
  * When I felt burnt out, I would research new tools and projects to let my mind settle
* Was able to move all programs from static sites to the CSM over the span of about a year and a half.
  * Since we moved our content into a CMS, I heard the next rewrite was able to be automated

## 3. Give me an example of a time when you set a goal and were able to meet or achieve it

## 4. Tell me about a time you had to quickly adjust your work priorities to meet changing demands.

Sridevi

* Creating SAPUI5 Apps for CRM 
* As part of my application, I was tasked with implementing a selection process for products.
  * Near the end of the project, it was decided that the users should be able to select from a tree instead of a flat dropdown.
* Rather than only pushing back on changes, I chose to adopt the "agile mindset"
  * "Change is going to happen.  Expect it, but also put your self in a position to respond to it"

| Situation | SAPUI5 CRM | Creating SAPUI5 Apps for CRM  |
| Task | Product Select | Implementing the selection process for products.  Near the end of the project, it was decided that the users should be able to select from a tree instead of a flat dropdown. |
| Action | Agile mindset | This was a change in the requirements, so I asked for an extension of the time and was given it. |
| Result | Yay for welcoming change | Got it done.  In the context of waterfall, this would have been frustrating and interruptive.  However, I am used to changing requirements and believe that they should be welcomed so the user can have the best experience we can give them. |
