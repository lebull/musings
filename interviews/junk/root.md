# Amazon Interview Plan

## General Questions to expect

### From the recruiter

* Data, data, data. Amazon is a data-driven company, so please be prepared to explain how you personally have utilized data, found new resources to harvest data and anything in between in order to drive to your results.
    * Something to keep in mind. The use of “I” versus “we” as you speak to your interviewer – it’s good to acknowledge the work of your team, but this is your time to brag and shine about your individual contributions, so do not hold back on your accomplishments.
* I cannot emphasize enough, that your interviewer will ask you open-ended questions to see what follow up questions you ask in return. When you’re asked a broad question, ensure you ask clarifying questions to understand requirements and then begin to solve last after you’ve communicated clearly your path to solve. Also, consider/ask about edge cases before they’re brought to your attention.
