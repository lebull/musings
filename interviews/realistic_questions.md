| ----- |-----  | ----- |
| Situation | SAPUI5 CRM | Creating SAPUI5 Apps for CRM  |
| Task | Product Select | Implementing the selection process for products.  Near the end of the project, it was decided that the users should be able to select from a tree instead of a flat dropdown. |
| Action | Extend Time | This was a change in the requirements, so I asked for an extension of the time and was given it. |
| Result | Yay for 'Agility' | Got it done.  In the context of waterfall, this would have been frustrating and interruptive.  However, I am used to changing requirements and believe that they should be welcomed so the user can have the best experience we can give them. |
