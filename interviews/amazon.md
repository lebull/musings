# Amazon Interview Plan

## General Questions to expect

### From the recruiter

* Data, data, data. Amazon is a data-driven company, so please be prepared to explain how you personally have utilized data, found new resources to harvest data and anything in between in order to drive to your results.
    * Something to keep in mind. The use of “I” versus “we” as you speak to your interviewer – it’s good to acknowledge the work of your team, but this is your time to brag and shine about your individual contributions, so do not hold back on your accomplishments.
* I cannot emphasize enough, that your interviewer will ask you open-ended questions to see what follow up questions you ask in return. When you’re asked a broad question, ensure you ask clarifying questions to understand requirements and then begin to solve last after you’ve communicated clearly your path to solve. Also, consider/ask about edge cases before they’re brought to your attention.

# Amazon Leadership Principles Examples

## Customer Obsession

    Leaders start with the
    customer and work backwards. They work vigorously
    to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders
    pay attention to competitors, they obsess over
    customers.

I've been asked this before.  It gets weird for some, but as a UI person, this is front and center.

|       |       |
| ----- | ----- |
| Situation | Annual Survey at International Paper (myView) |
| Task | As a developer for internal applications, I was asked if I felt the company was focused on the customer |
| Action | This tripped me up because I write internal stuff, but the reality is the users of my app have constant direct interaction with the customers.  Because no one in any IT team had any direct user feedback, we had no idea what we could do to give our reps the best opportunity to make our customers happy |
| Result | Other teammates had similar concerns.  However, it was decided on review that another pain-point was to be focused on.  I continued my efforts by advocating for the ability for users to provide direct feedback within the app shell. |

## Ownership

    Leaders are owners. They think long term
    and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term
    results. They act on behalf of the entire company,
    beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s
    not my job”.

* Distance internal apps (taken over from a class project)


## Invent and Simplify

    Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find way to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here”. As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

## Are Right, a Lot

    Leaders are right a lot. They have
    strong business judgment and good instincts. They
    seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm
    their beliefs.

## Learn and Be Curious

    Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

## Hire and Develop the Best

    Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people in invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

## Insist on the Highest Standards

    Leaders have relentlessly high standards – many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

### Thoughts on the topic

This is crucial in frontend development.  Falling short of standards directly impacts users. This is especially if the app is external.  However, even internal applications 

### STAR Examples

|       |       |
| ----- | ----- |
| Situation | Poor user experience for pestweb.com.  Boss wasn't interested in fixing them because we were due to scrap the site within 12-18 months. |
| Task | x |
| Action | Started up a pipeline of improvements to  |
| Result | x |


## Think Big

    Think Big Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

## Bias for Action

    Bias for Action Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

Casper's "We are doing Scrum now"

## Frugality (unlikely)

    Frugality Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

This is super important in UI things

## Earn Trust

    Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

## Dive Deep

    Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

    |       |       |
    | ----- | ----- |
    | Situation | IP Launchpad App |
    | Task | Recustomize on every update |
    | Action | Decided to automate this process |
    | Result | Went from a custom script to discovering task managers like grunt/gulp.  Snowballed into being able to easilly add other important steps like building and publishing |

## Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit

    Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

## Deliver Result

    Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
